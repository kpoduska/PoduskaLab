I use physics to make complex problems more tractable.*  I enjoy working with <a href="research.html">interdisciplinary teams</a> on research questions related to improving environmental sustainability, including their science and social justice aspects. <a href="cv.html">Learn more about my activities here</a>.

<p>

Those who work in my research group gain valuable generalist training in materials physics to address <a href="projects.html">timely fundamental and applied research challenges</a>. Much of our recent work relates to solid forms of carbon-rich materials, including carbonate minerals.

<i>* Do you know the spherical cow joke in physics? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">Read it here.</a> This joke pokes fun at physicists, but it's one that we share around within the discipline to highlight what makes our approach to problems somewhat unique: by simplifying a problem, we can make it more tractable and easier to get a useful answer. What's important here is that we know that we're not getting all of the details right -- we focus instead on getting a result that helps us move forward in our thinking, our planning, and our understanding. This at the core of how I do my research. It's a powerful approach!</i>
