<TD width="*"  align="left" valign="center" >  Carbonate minerals are important sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, but their degradation can release the carbon dioxide back into the air or could contribute to pH changes in aqueous environments. This means that improving our understanding of processes such as ocean acidification, water remediation, and atmosphere-water interactions requires a better understanding of the complex interplay between carbonate minerals and their local environment.  <a href="research.html">We use laboratory experiments, as well as theoretical simulations, to investigate the evolution of and variations within carbonate mineral structures.</a>  <br><br> Collaborators include: <a href="https://www.physics.mun.ca/~saika/">Ivan Saika-Voivod</a> and Entcho Demirov (Memorial Physics), Kelly Hawboldt (Memorial Engineering)

<!--How do different kinds of imperfections affect the way that vibrations propagate in a solid? <a href="?content=pubs&topic=research">We use different material characterization techniques on the same material to study it at different length scales.</a>  Imperfections in solids can take many forms, ranging from Angstrom-scale differences in atomic arrangements, to nm-scale variations in a solid's periodicity, to microscopic pores and cracks.  These results help us to identify specific disorder signatures in a material that can tell us how it formed or evolved over time.  -->

<TD width="*"  align="left" valign="center" > During earthquakes, strong waves can change the material through which they travel, often slowing the seismic wave. However, it is still an open question as to which material factors most influence seismic wave speeds? <a href="research.html">Our lab-scale experiments show clues by tracking wave speeds in porous rock.</a>  We are especially interested in exploring both the wave physics and the materials physics that are important for understanding dynamic pump-probe experiments.<br><br> Collaborators include: <a href="http://www.esd.mun.ca/~amalcolm/">Alison Malcolm</a> (Memorial Earth Sciences)

<TD width="*"  align="left" valign="center" >  We are part of a multi-disciplinary team including university, government, and industry experts that is working to simulate an end-to-end mission to Mars using remote sensing to search for signs of microbial life. A water-rock reaction known as serpentinization has the potential to support life on other worlds. Based on this, we are designing a drone-based search for infrared spectroscopic signatures and other remote-sensing evidence of serpentization in a unique area of Newfoundland's west coast to that is a Mars analogue site of serpentinization.

have a wide range of potential medical applications.

Adding collagen or other proteins to mineral coatings to form a bioinorganic composite material can increase the biocompatibility of the coating. <a href="research.html">We use electrochemical methods to make mineral films and collagen membranes, and we study the mineral-protein symbiosis involved in making biocomposite coatings.</a> <br><br> Collaborators include: <a href="https://www.mun.ca/faculty/emerschrod/">Erika Merschrod</a> (Memorial Chemistry), <a href="http://www.med.mun.ca/Medicine/Faculty/Gendron,-Robert.aspx">Bob Gendron</a> and  <a href="http://www.med.mun.ca/Medicine/Faculty/Paradis,-Helene.aspx">Helene Paradis</a> (Memorial Medicine), <a href="https://islandscholar.ca/people/lmcduffee">Laurie McDuffee</a> (Atlantic Veterinary College and University of Prince Edward Island)</TD>
